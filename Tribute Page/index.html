      <p>the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is the founder and captain of the increasing and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as of its top four fighters. His lifelong journey is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. After his invasion of Totto Land and actions against the Yonko Big Mom, he is currently considered by the global press to be the Fifth Emperor.</p>
      <p>He is the son of the Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon, the Paternal grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, the word brother of late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace and Revolutionary Chief of Staff Sabo and the foster son of Curly Dadan</p>
      <p>Luffy has a worldwide reputation for causing trouble, challenging the Shichibukai, the Marines, and the Yonko, additionally committing felonies and actions  which were deemed threatening by the World Government. Furthermore, in the majority of these confrontations, he has emerged as the victor. He has gained a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some cases, "insane", after causing an incident in Enies Lobby, assaulting a World Noble at Sabaody Archipelago, entering and escaping from Impel Down(while indirectly causing a large-scale riot in the process), and joining the Battle of Marineford. He is therefore, infamous for being the only known pirate to not only deliberately attack the three most important government facilities, but also escape from all of the them alive after facing incredibly powerful opponents in each one. The additional fact that he punched a World Noble with full knowledge of the consequences, as well as his heritgas, he caused Luffy to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element", earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki and Marine Headquarters.
